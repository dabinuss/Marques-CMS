Welcome to **Marques CMS** ‚Äì a modular, flexible, and file-based (Flat File) content management system developed in multiple stages. üéâ

## Overview

Marques CMS is designed to lay the foundation for a modern, user-friendly CMS‚Äîwithout using a traditional database! With a clean architecture and modular structure, we aim to make content creation and management as pleasant as possible. Development is carried out in clearly defined phases, each adding important core functionality and extended features.

## Requirements

Marques requires no databases, packages, or server environments. It works on simple web hosting services. Therefore, there are no specific requirements.
- **No special requirements**
- PHP Version 8 (only tested at)
- Webspace

## Installation

The CMS is still under development. For testing, simply upload the project under `/marques/` and open it in your browser. In `/config/users.config.php/`, you can create and edit users. Note that passwords must be stored as PHP password hashes.
